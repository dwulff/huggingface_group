# Hugging Face Group

This is the home of the MPIB-Unibas-CAS Hugging Face Training Group. 

### Rules

1. This repo belongs to everyone. Make changes as you see fit. Assume others will.
2. If you have a message for everyone, create an issue. It will trigger an email to everyone.  
2. Do not upload non-public data.
3. Pull before you push.

### Files

1. Resources.md - Live document with helpful resources on neural networks, transformers, and applications to (psychological) science. 
2. Code/ - Folder for your scripts and notebooks
  a. Please include here scripts used in live coding. It makes sense to use the jupyter notebooks provided by the book authors (https://github.com/nlp-with-transformers/notebooks). This     allows us to keep environments similar across all our machines. Feel free to edit as you see fit. We can even use issues to highlight things and keep track of problems on specific OS       versions or whatever. Github is our friend here and we can make use of its functions :)
